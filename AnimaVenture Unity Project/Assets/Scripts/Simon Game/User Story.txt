 - Display the number of sequence you've gotten to.
If wrong, save curret sequence number, replay sequence. 
If right, add one to sequence as normal, if wrong repeat above.

 	TIMER
 - Counts down from 2mins. Everytime you get sequence right subtract x 
 - when timer is finished, 'keep playing' or 'meditate',

	STARS
 - spawn from specific transforms, move towards centre transform,
display symbol when at that transform, then move off screen.
